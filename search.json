Introduce the Context\n\nPresent the quiz task: students will identify whether a headline came from CNN or The Onion.\nExplain that students will make a prior prediction, then update it using quiz results.\n\n\n\n2. Construct Priors\n\nStudents choose a prior model for the proportion of correct answers they expect people to get on the quiz and translate it into a Beta distribution.\n\nOptimistic: Beta(8, 3)\nUndecided: Beta(1, 1)\nPessimistic: Beta(5, 10)\nVery Optimistic: Beta(140, 10)\n\n\n\n\n3. Visualize Priors\n\nUse plot_beta() to examine shapes of priors.\nStudents compare their prior to reference priors and discuss informativeness.\n\n\n\n4. Take the Quiz\n\nStudents complete the quiz and count their correct responses.\n\n\n\n5. Update with Data\n\nStudents update their prior using their own score: plot_beta_binomial() and summarize_beta_binomial().\nStudents repeat the update process adding classmates’ scores (n = 30, then n = 45) tallying the correct responses each time.\n\n\n\n6. Update with the Class Data or the Provided Data\n\nUse the provided data or ask each student to share their score. Add these together. n will become 15 x number of students.\nStudents update their prior using the class score: plot_beta_binomial() and summarize_beta_binomial().\n\n\n\n7. Compare Posteriors\n\nVisual comparison: look at posterior distributions from different priors side by side.\nNumeric comparison: interpret changes in mean, mode, and standard deviation."

This means that before seeing any data, we assign equal plausibility to all possible values of \\(\\pi\\), the probability that someone guesses a headline correctly.\nWe’re saying we have no reason to favor any particular value of \\(\\pi\\) between 0 and 1. In contrast, Beta(8,8) assumes some structure, it implies we already believe the success rate is centered around 0.5 with some confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to interpret a Density Plot\n\n\n\n\nStart by looking at the x-axis, which shows the possible values of the parameter (here, the probability \\(\\pi\\) of guessing correctly), and the y-axis, which shows the plausibility or density of those values.\nThe peak of the curve indicates the most likely value (the mode), and the width reflects uncertainty—narrow curves suggest high certainty, while wide curves indicate more uncertainty.\nThe area under the curve between two points represents how probable it is that the parameter falls in that range.\nWhen comparing prior and posterior distributions, look at how the curve shifts and narrows to see how beliefs change with data.\nAlways describe what you see: Is the distribution centered high or low? Is it narrow or wide? Did the data change the belief significantly?"
